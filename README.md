Hi Pavel,

Thanks for showing an interest in joining our team & speaking with myself today!

We are excited to get to know your technical skills better and would like to invite you to complete an assignment related to our area of work - blockchain.

This exercise is designed to assess how you approach tasks required in your position as a frontend developer at stakefish. Your time is important to us, and we don’t expect you to spend more time than available on this task. We value quality over feature completeness. We are interested not just in your final results, but also in seeing how you work. Please include useful git commit messages, and use comments where you think your code may be unclear.

The Task:

Using the Coingecko public API (https://www.coingecko.com/en/api), build an application that will serve as a directory of cryptocurrency exchanges. The main page should be a list with the first ten exchanges with some high-level information (name, country, URL, logo, trust rank).

When the user clicks on an exchange, show its details on a separate page. Included in those details should be the name, country, trust rank, logo, year of establishment, social media links, description, and a back-to-main-page button.

Tech Stack:

As long as the solution is built using React, you can use any other tools you like.

Browser Support:

You should test your work in the latest version of Chrome. If you use any features that are not supported by common browsers or IE 11, you should mention these features and how you would provide a suitable fallback experience if your code does not do so already.

Dependencies:

Please use `npm` for dependency management.

You can use any 3rd-party libraries as necessary or desired, but we prefer the use of minimal dependencies.

Coding Standard:

Your styles should be responsive and mobile-first. Please use ESLint and Prettier to format your code.

Evaluation:

Your React app should build without errors. If there are extra steps required to get it to compile, they should be covered in your README.md.
Your commit history is important to us. Try to make meaningful commit messages that show your progress.
Your code should be easy to understand and communicative (e.g. in comments, variable names, etc). Clean code principles, componentization, appropriate test coverage, and code documentation are key factors and are highly valued.
Bonus points for testing (stakefish ❤️ end-to-end testing with Cypress).

Please aim to return to us your solution, including all the files you would like to share within 3 business days.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the timeline, please feel free to contact us.

For public repositories, we ask that you make it private once you have received feedback. If you decide to make the repository private immediately after competition, please ensure you allow access to all of the below usernames:

'mbaranovski', 'yzhuang', 'apple-juice', 'vince19972', 'mateuszsokola'

We hope you enjoy this and happy coding!

Best,

Ben Clark
